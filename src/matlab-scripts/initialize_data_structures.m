% this function initializes all the variables needed to store the data
% input from the Arduino, and to alter it to control the virtual hand. 
% 
% data is a vector of arbitrarily large size to store the incoming EMG data
% from the arduino. initially set to the value NaN.
% 
% 
% dataindex stores the current index of where the most recent EMG data
% received is stored, initially set to 1, but is updated each time new data
% is received.
% 
% control index is the most recent control command will be stored. updated
% each time control value is calculated
% 
% prevSamp stores the value of the previous sample, and will be updated
% each time graphs are updated
% 
% previousTimeStamp is used to limit the rate of control if a delay is
% used.
