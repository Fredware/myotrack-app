# MyoTrack App: Spasticity Management with Real-Time Biofeedback
This project explores a real-time biofeedback system, MyoTrack App, to help stroke patients manage spasticity, a condition causing muscle stiffness.

## Motivation:
Spasticity poses a significant challenge for stroke rehabilitation. Traditional assessment methods can be subjective and time-consuming. This project aims to provide a user-friendly tool for:

Objective Spasticity Monitoring: By leveraging established time-constant characterization of muscle activity (e.g., EMG), the app calculates spasticity scores in real-time.
Patient Empowerment: A user-friendly interface displays these scores, allowing patients to actively monitor their spasticity throughout the day.

## Project Highlights:
Real-Time Feedback System: Designed based on time-constant analysis of muscle activity data for spasticity assessment.
User-Friendly Application: Provides a real-time interface to visualize spasticity scores.
Pilot Study Results: A pilot study with two stroke patients showed a reduction in the time-constant distribution after using the app, suggesting potential benefits for managing spasticity.

## Future Directions:
This research lays the groundwork for developing user-centric tools equipped with real-time spasticity feedback.  Future work will focus on:

Large-Scale Clinical Trials: Validate the effectiveness of the app in improving spasticity management and rehabilitation outcomes.
Advanced Spasticity Assessment: Integrate additional sensors and machine learning approaches for a more comprehensive evaluation.
